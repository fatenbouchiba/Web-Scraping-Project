# Web Scraping Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to extract job data from a website using Python and BeautifulSoup. I used **RemoteOK** to scrape data for remote developer jobs, focusing on job titles, company names, locations, and more.

## Approach
I wrote Python code that:
- Sends HTTP requests to the website.
- Parses the HTML of job postings.
- Extracts relevant data (job title, company, location, etc.).
- Saves the results in a CSV file.

## Key Findings
- There were no missing or duplicate entries.
- The dataset consists of job postings for various roles like Backend Engineer, Full-Stack Developer, etc.
- The data reveals the most common job titles and companies that post remote jobs.

## How to Use
You can run the notebook in Google Colab or your local environment. Simply download the `.ipynb` file and execute the cells to scrape data from RemoteOK.

## Files
- `remoteok_webscraping.ipynb`: The notebook that contains the entire web scraping process.
- `remoteok_jobs.csv`: A sample output of the scraped job data.
